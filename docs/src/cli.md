# cli

The utiles cli can be installed via cargo or pip; the python library bundles
a version of the cli that can be run just as `utiles` and/or `python -m utiles`.

The cli is a collection of commands for streaming tiles in text format (excellent for piping) and working with mbtiles/tile-db files.

All of the `mercantile` cli commands are available, and `burn` and `edges` from `supermercado` are also available.

## What about the `mbtiles` cli in the martin repo? [2025-01-14]

The `mbtiles` cli is very good and has significant overlap with the `utiles` cli. 

(imo) The most intriguing feature of the `mbtiles` cli is the `diff`/`patch` commands
that allow for comparing and updating mbtiles files; `utiles` does not have this feature.

`utiles` does have a streaming mode copy command that allows copying tiles from one mbtiles db to another without using the `sqlite-ATTACH` command; this is in my testing and experience less crash-prone and much faster on super large tile-dbs.

The cli commands in `utiles` that interact with mbtiles are more focused `raster` format `mbtiles` files.


### `agg-hash`


`utiles` adopted the standardized way of calculating an `aggregate-tiles-hash` for an mbtiles file, and builds on it to allow for hash-algorithms aside from `md5`. The cli command also allows for selecting zoom-levels, and bounding-boxes to calculate the hash over.

The default hashing alg is `md5` to match the martin `mbtiles` cli; but may change if I get around to updating some of our (dgi's) very large datasets; 
`xxh64` is generally very fast.


```bash
> utiles agg-hash -z 2 osm-standard.z0z4.mbtiles
{
  "hash_type": "md5",
  "hash": "F211FF7D9FF917B58808302E0AAE82FF",
